# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is a simple webpage to store notes on the prework modules for
the coding bootcamp. A lot of information was being shown to us so being able
to keep it in once place while putting this knoledge to work was important. This page did achive its goal of helping have once place for all out notes and
help us develope out beggining understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. We learnt how to structure style and give funtionality to a webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We also leant version control with Git.
